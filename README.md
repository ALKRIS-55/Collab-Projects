## Self-Driving Car Using Udacity's Car Simulator and Deep Neural Networks
**Overview**
- **Libraries:** Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, and imgaug for data augmentation and model training.
- **Data Handling:** Processes driving log data, applies image augmentation (zoom, pan, brightness adjustment, flipping).
- **Model Architecture:** Based on NVIDIAâ€™s self-driving car model with convolutional layers and dropout for regularization.
- **Training:** Uses Adam optimizer, mean squared error loss, and fit generator for training and validation data.
- **Output:** Trained model predicts steering angles, saved as model.h5.

## Dropout Prediction
**Overview**
-**Loading and Understanding the Data:**
- The dataset is loaded using pandas, and its basic structure is examined.
- Information about the columns, their data types, and non-null counts is obtained.
- The count of missing values in each column is calculated and found to be zero.
-**Data Preprocessing:**
- The target variable, initially represented as 'Graduate', 'Dropout', and 'Enrolled', is transformed into numerical labels (0, 1, 2) for classification purposes.
- Histograms are generated to visualize the distributions of numeric features.
-**Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis:**
- Correlation coefficients between features and the target variable are calculated.
- The most correlated features with the target variable are identified for further analysis.
-**Scaling the Dataset:**
- The dataset is standardized using the StandardScaler to bring all features to the same scale, which is a common preprocessing step in many machine learning algorithms.
-**Splitting the Dataset:**
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using train_test_split.
- The stratify parameter is used to maintain the distribution of the target variable in each split.
-**Model Building and Evaluation:**
- Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed to find the optimal number of neighbors for the KNN algorithm.
- Cross-validation techniques are employed to assess the models' performance and generalization ability.
